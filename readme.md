Data repository for our paper "["My Answer is C": First-Token Probabilities Do Not Match Text Answers in Instruction-Tuned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14499)"

This repo contains the annotated data we used for training our evaluator in `labeled_model_output`, and the model output with mapping result in `outputs`.
